[Press Space to Skip]

In the midst of the
roaring 2x20's, a
small, vocal minority
has suceeded in passing
The 2nd Prohibition Act.

Ethyl alcohols are
prohibited on all
planets in the federation,
much to the ire of
the Afengisbjugur
who breathe alcohol.

After the mass
extinction, the
Afengisbjugur Aerospace
company, AA, lays
the groundwork for
the resistance.

Meanwhile, the
Teatoat Party, suddenly
finding they have little
to do, enlists en-masse
to assist in enforcing
their new law.

They, combined with a
neutral group that doesn't
believe in the cause but
enjoys violence, form the
basis for The New Empire.

tl;dr
Fly ships.
Games are art.
